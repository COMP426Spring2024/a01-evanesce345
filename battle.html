            <h1>Theseus vs. The Minotaur</h1>
            <p>After Theseus joined his father King Aegeus in Athens, he soon after learned that seven Athenian boys and seven Athenian girls would shortly have to be sent 
                to Crete and face the Minotaur in the Labyrinth as a form of retribution for King Minos’s son being murdered in Athens years prior. Theseus, of course, 
                decided he would take the place of one of the boys and display his might by slaying the Minotaur <span>(because it’s all just one big game to him)</span>. 
                His father, realizing that was a terrible idea, tried to persuade him not to go, but Theseus was determined. In hopes that Theseus would return home safely, 
                Aegeus gave his son white sails to replace the black sails on his ship when returning from Crete if he happened to still be alive.
            </p>
            <p>Upon arrival in Crete, Theseus announced to King Minos his plans to slay the Minotaur. Minos thought the beast to be a threat to the world, 
                and that was the reason he locked him in the Labyrinth in the first place, so he offered Theseus freedom for himself and his fellow Athenians if he succeeded 
                <span>(without assitance, that is)</span>.
            </p>
            <p>Theseus also caught the attention of Princess Ariadne, daughter of King Minos, and she fell deeply in love with him <span>(That quickly? She barely knew the guy…)</span>. 
                To help him out in the Labyrinth, Ariadne bestowed him with a ball of thread that he could unravel to help him navigate the maze and keep track of where he was going. 
                She also told him the secret to navigating the maze – information she garnered from the Labyrinth’s creator, Daedalus: only go forward and down and never left or right.
            </p>
            <p>Following the instructions of Princess Ariadne, Theseus tactfully navigated the multitude pathways and turns and stumbled into the den of the sleeping Minotaur. 
                The beast awoke and fought a gruesome battle with Theseus, who managed to stab the creature in the throat and decapitate the half-man half-bull.

            <p>Using the thread given to him, Theseus was able to find his way out of the dungeon, and he proceeded to escape Crete with his brethren and Ariadne. On the way back to Athens, 
                they stopped at the island of Naxos to rest for the night. Early the next morning, they set sail again, but accidentally left Ariadne on the shore because she was still asleep 
                <span>(forgetting about your partner in that situation is crazy)</span>. Luckily <span>(or unluckily depending on your perception of the Greek gods)</span>, Ariadne was later 
                rescued by and married to Dionysus. Theseus, becoming forgetful all of a sudden, also didn’t remember to put up the white sails to signal his safety to his father. 
            </p>
            <p>From atop a cliff face, King Aegeus saw the returning ship with black sails and was heartbroken. Assuming his son was dead, he hurled himself off the cliff and died. 
                The body of water he fell into later became known as the Aegean Sea.

            <h1>Birth of a Beast</h1>
            <p>The minotaur <span>(not to be confused with centaur)</span> was an aggressive and highly destructive creature that was half-man and half-bull. For some reason, 
                Greek mythology has a lot of half-and-halfs and it can get confusing trying to understand which half is which animal. Here’s a fun table of some of the most well-known creatures:
            </p>
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th></th>
                        <th>Top Half</th>
                        <th>Bottom Half</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Minotaur</th>
                        <td>Bull</td>
                        <td>Human</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Centaur</th>
                        <td>Human</td>
                        <td>Horse</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Satyr</th>
                        <td>Human</td>
                        <td>Goat</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Harpy</th>
                        <td>Human</td>
                        <td>Bird</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Griffin</th>
                        <td>Bird (eagle)</td>
                        <td>Lion</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            <p>Anyway, the Minotaur was birthed from his mother, Pasiphae, wife of King Minos of Crete <span>(not to be confused with King Midas of Phrygia)</span>, 
                who was possessed by Poseidon to fall in love with a white bull that her husband refused to sacrifice to the god. To achieve her lustrous goal, she employed Daedalus, 
                the same person who created the famous Labyrinth for the king, to build her a wooden bull that she could hide in and mate with the bull <span>(perhaps not his proudest work)</span>.

                <figcaption>Minotaur in Labyrinth</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Once King Minos discovered Pasiphae’s shocking endeavor, rather than kill the beast he decided to forever lock it away in his Labyrinth. In his new home, 
                the minotaur was routinely fed seven Athenian boys and seven Aethenian girls every nine years. Why? Well, because of past quarrels between Crete and Athens.
            </p>
            <p>King Minos’s eldest son, Androgeus, at some point traveled to Athens. Different versions of the myth give different reasons for why he was there and what happened to him, 
                but perhaps the most relevant is that he participated in the Panathenaic games, but he was just so good <span>(goated, even)</span> that the Pallantides (fifty sons of Pallas) 
                were resentful and assassinated him. This understandably made King Minos furious, and he demanded retribution.

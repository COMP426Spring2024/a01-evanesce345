            <h1>Early Life of Theseus</h1>
            <p>Theseus was quite a notable figure in Greek mythology. He went on many adventures and founded the city of Athens, but of course those aren't the stories you're here for.
            </p>

                <figcaption>Theseus uncovering the rock his father placed.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Theseus was the son of Aethra and Aegeus (mother and father, respectively), and before he was born his mother received instructions from Athena in a dream, 
                which led her to get possessed by Poseidon <span>(a Greek classic, of course)</span> which led to Theseus having some divine attributes. 
                When Aethra was pregnant, Aegeus skedaddled back to Athens to rule <span>(the ancient Greek equivalent to going out for milk, I suppose)</span>, 
                but not before burying his sandals and sword under a rock and telling Aethra if Theseus was a gigachad he’d be able to lift the rock and join his father in Athens.
            </p>
            <p>When Theseus grew older, he uncovered the stone his father had placed, and he journeyed to Athens to be reunited with him and take his place as a royal 
                <span>(and once again his mother was abandoned by the only person in her life)</span>.
                
            </p>
            <p>To demonstrate his capabilities, Theseus took the deadliest path imaginable on his way to Athens. He encountered six people <span>(one wasn’t even a person, but a giant pig)</span> 
                who were so dangerous they were nicknamed the six entrances to the underworld, or Six Labors. They tried to kill him in variously gruesome ways 
                <span>(one guy tried to feed him to a giant turtle, but Theseus played an UNO reverse card)</span>, but of course our hero came out on top.
            </p>
            <p>Arriving in Athens, Theseus’s father didn’t recognize him at first, but his wife, Medea (the same one in the story of Jason, if you’re familiar), 
                immediately knew who he was and, fearing that Theseus would steal the throne from her own son, attempted to poison the young hero. 
                Luckily, right before Theseus took a swig, his father used his eyes and noticed the sword and sandals he was wearing, and he knocked the poisoned wine cup out of his hands. 
                Medea <span>(understandably)</span> fled.
